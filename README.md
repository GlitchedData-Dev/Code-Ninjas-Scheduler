# Code Ninjas Scheduler
We made this cause we're lazy shits and can't be bothered to manually type in a schedule every month

---
### TODO
 - User profiles (for funsies)
 - Automatic updates
 - ~~Make sure number of buttons matches the number of days in the current month~~
 - Shift preferences
 - Password encryption

# How to configure the scheduler
To configure the sender name, email etc go to the settings tab by clicking the hamburger in the top right
You can then enter sender email, password, name and recipient email
Sender email and password are your Email and the password you would use to access your inbox
